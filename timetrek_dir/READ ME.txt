INSTALLATION

Timetrek does not have an "installer" so you may 
want to create a new folder within your "Program Files" 
or "Applications" folder named "Timetrek" then move 
the program into the newly cread folder.

To launch Timetrek simply double click 
on the application icon.

The very first time you use Timetrek, 
it will create a few folders within 
the same folder as the application.
These folders are named as follows:
- projects
- reports
- trash

These folders are used to store all 
of your project's data.

If you're handy with editing HTML, 
you can open the file named "report_template.html", 
(which is located within the "reports" folder).
And change the look and feel of your reports.
Items within the HTML that are wrapped by !!! are 
placeholders for specific kinds of data. You can 
move these items around to meet your needs.

I hope this program helps you as much as it 
has helped me over the years!

Peace,
